# IP Address Finder

## Overview

The IP Address Finder is a console-based application developed in C to manage and find IP addresses using a Splay Tree data structure. It simulates the assignment of data packets to IP addresses.

## Features

1. **Insertion of IP Addresses**
    - Allows insertion of IP addresses into the Splay Tree.
2. **Search for IP Addresses**
    - Searches for a specific IP address and splay it to the root.
3. **Data Packet Assignment**
    - Randomly assigns data packets to IP addresses.
4. **Display IP Addresses**
    - Displays all IP addresses along with their assigned data packets in an in-order traversal.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** C
- **Libraries:** Standard C Libraries

## How to Use

### Prerequisites

- A C compiler (e.g., gcc, clang)
- Visual Studio Code (or any other C IDE)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/IP-Address-Finder.git
    cd IP-Address-Finder
    ```

2. **Compile the Code**
    ```bash
    gcc -o IPAddressFinder main.c
    ```

3. **Run the Program**
    ```bash
    ./IPAddressFinder
    ```

## Code Structure

- `main.c`: The main file containing the implementation of the IP Address Finder using Splay Tree.

## Usage

1. Run the executable file created after compilation.
2. The program will automatically insert predefined IP addresses into the Splay Tree.
3. It will then assign random data packets to these IP addresses.
4. Finally, it will display all IP addresses with their corresponding data packets.
